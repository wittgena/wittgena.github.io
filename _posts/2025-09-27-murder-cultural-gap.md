> “Why did he kill?” — and more importantly, why can’t we understand it?

Park Chan-wook’s latest film *It's Okay Because It's Not* (Korean: 어쩔 수가 없다) has stirred an unexpected divergence in response: lukewarm and uncomfortable reception in Korea, versus critical acclaim in much of the Anglosphere.

This isn’t simply about taste in movies. Both the film and its source material — Donald E. Westlake’s darkly satirical novel *The Ax* — share the same premise: a laid-off man begins murdering his job competitors to reclaim a position in society. But where one audience sees irony, the other sees implausibility. Where one feels reflection, the other feels repulsion.

This essay explores why. Not by comparing cinematic elements or storytelling techniques, but by looking deeper — into the **cultural binding structures** that determine how acts like murder are emotionally, ethically, and narratively grounded across societies.

Why is the idea of *killing for a job* absurdly satirical to some, yet emotionally unanchored and morally repellent to others?

To answer this, we must look at how cultures differ not only in what stories they tell, but in **how they accept, reject, or phase-bind violence to meaning**.

## Westlake’s *The Ax*: Murder as Economic Satire

In Westlake’s original novel, the protagonist Burke is a middle-aged man laid off from a paper company. After a year of unemployment and rejection, he begins plotting to **eliminate his competition for a job** — literally. One by one, he kills rival candidates.

But the tone is not horror or tragedy — it’s **dark satire**. The novel exaggerates the logic of capitalism to an absurd conclusion: *What if, to survive economically, you had to kill someone?* In this framing, murder is not personal rage but **a systemic mirror**, a grotesque outcome of neoliberal pressure.

Western readers and viewers, steeped in traditions of black comedy and ironic detachment, are more accustomed to interpreting this as **symbolic violence**, not as a realistic portrayal of behavior.

## In Korea: Murder Cannot Be the Endpoint of Normal Competition

In contrast, Korean audiences have reacted with discomfort or disbelief. Not because they don’t understand the brutality of competition — Korea’s social pressures, job insecurity, and hyper-meritocratic systems are well documented.

But the **emotional and ethical structure** of Korean culture rarely permits the connection:

> **“I may collapse. I may break. But I won’t kill someone else to survive.”**

Even in media portrayals, when violence emerges, it is often tragic, accidental, or externally justified — not coldly logical. Korean narratives about economic despair tend to turn inward (suicidal ideation, shame, family collapse) rather than outward (homicide).

This is not moral superiority, but a **cultural binding difference** — in Korea, the act of killing, especially for personal gain, remains **ethically and narratively unanchored**.

## Phase Structure Comparison: Emotion, Narrative, Social Intuition, and Reflection

| Phase | Korean Audience | Western Audience |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Action Grounding** | Acts must be emotionally anchored to community, family, dignity | Actions can be symbolic, ironic, exaggerated |
| **Story Logic** | Narratives focus on collective pain, not lone rational evil | Narrative forms include absurdist satire, personal nihilism |
| **Social Intuition** | Practical logic resists extreme jumps from pain → murder | Cultural intuition permits extreme outcomes as critique |
| **Reflective Distance** | Self-reflection loops break if the act feels too alien | Irony allows detachment and structural reflection |

This helps explain why Korean viewers often react with, *“I don’t understand why he would do that”*, whereas Western reviewers might say, *“That’s disturbing — but also brilliant.”*

## The Cultural Anchor of Violence

Ultimately, *It's Okay Because It's Not* tests the limits of what Korean audiences are willing to internalize. It presents **a reflective challenge** — not just of one man’s breakdown, but of a society’s willingness to explain (or deny) the connection between survival and violence.

The difference lies not in morality, but in **resonance**:

> In Korea, murder as economic logic breaks emotional and narrative alignment.  
> In the West, the same logic can be viewed as critique, irony, or allegory.

This is not a failure of one culture to “get it,” but rather a **deeply rooted divergence in how stories are bound to emotion, ethics, and cultural structure**.

And so the question lingers:

> “Was it really inevitable?”

That is what Park Chan-wook dares to ask — and different cultures, reflecting through their own binding structures, answer in very different ways.
