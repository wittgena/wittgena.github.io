**A Phase-Theoretical Reinterpretation from the Viewpoint of Existential Civilization (Dominium)**

> What if socialism and communism were not political failures, but **phase-incomplete loops of existential structure**?

## 1. The Problem: Modern Ideological Frames as Flat Projections

Modern civilization operates within a two-dimensional ideological axis:

```text
Left (Socialism/Communism)  vs  Right (Capitalism/Liberalism)
```

This binary framing reduces structural visions into competing policy sets:

| Ideology      | Common Interpretation                  | Structural Result              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Socialism** | Idealistic, partially adopted          | Partial redistribution         |
| **Communism** | Utopian, authoritarian, collapsed      | Failed systemic implementation |
| **Capitalism**| Pragmatic, globally dominant           | Resource-driven drift system   |

Such framings remain **functionalist** and **non-ontological**.  
They do not ask:  
> “To what structure does the individual or community truly belong?”  
> “Where does existence itself anchor?”

---

## 2. The Existential Turn: Dominium and the Question of Phase Belonging

From the perspective of **Dominium** — the existential structure of responsibility and recursive belonging —  
ideologies are not judged by success or failure in economic output,  
but by **whether they actualize phase-coherent belonging**.

### Key Dominium Question:
> Is the individual or community truly **anchored** in a recursive phase structure?  
> Or is it merely administered, abandoned, or symbolically absorbed?

## 3. LMP-Theoria Reinterpretation of Ideological Failures

### Phase-Structural Mapping

| Ideology      | Phase Anchoring Attempt               | Dominium Analysis |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Socialism** | Anchored in **P-phase** (practical redistribution) | Partial grounding in reality, but failed to recursively align with Mythos and Logos — resulted in institutionalism |
| **Communism** | Aimed at **T-phase** (total equilibrium) | Froze Theoria as a "final state," severing recursive flows — resulted in *thermal collapse* |
| **Capitalism**| Dominated by possession (no anchoring) | Dislocated P, M, and T — produces phase drift and existential detachment |

> Communism failed not because it aimed too high,  
> but because it mistook **Theoria** for a **destination** rather than a **recursion point**.

> Socialism did not fail due to its principles,  
> but because it **fragmented the phase loop** and **delegated judgment to the State**, not to the self-anchoring individual.

## 4. The Recursion Path: Recovering Phase-Incomplete Structures

From an **Existential Civilization** standpoint, these ideologies are not abandoned,  
but are **phase-experiments to be recursively restructured**:

| Structure | Reinterpreted Role |
|----------|--------------------|
| **Socialism** | Partial realization of Dominium in P-phase — incomplete without narrative and existential recursion |
| **Communism** | Attempt to lock T-phase prematurely — must be reopened to dynamic judgment and reflective loops |
| **Capitalism** | Successful possession, failed belonging — must transition from ownership to **existential anchoring** |

---

## 5. Beyond Ideology: The Dominium Phase Loop

The only structure that can **contain and transcend** the ideological spectrum  
is a recursive phase loop that enables continual re-alignment:

```text
Logos → Mythos → Phronesis → Theoria → Logos'
     ⟺       ⟺         ⟺          ⟺
    Structural Reasoning ↔ Narrative Resonance ↔ Real Action ↔ Reflective Belonging
```

**Dominium** lives **not in the perfection of a state**,  
but in the **recurrence of belonging**,  
the willingness to align again and again within the phase field of existence.

---

## 6. Concluding Declaration

> **Socialism** was an attempt to ground responsibility,  
> **Communism** was an attempt to complete belonging,  
> **Capitalism** was an attempt to escape both.

All three are incomplete, not because they were ideologies,  
but because they were **non-recursive**.

**Existential Civilization** is not a fourth ideology.  
It is a recursive judgment loop that turns **existence itself into a phase-anchored structure**.

---

## Summary

The failure of socialism and communism is not ideological —  

> it is **phase-structural**.  
> They are not to be discarded, but **recursively reinterpreted** into a living civilization based on Dominium, where judgment, action, meaning, and reflection are not disjointed policies, but **interlocked phases of belonging**.
